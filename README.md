Kodiak is a 3D game engine built off of Three.JS.
It will be entirely web-accessible, which means developers can create games in their
browsers and gamers can play games in their browsers. No downloads required!


Why is it called "Kodiak"?

This game engine was originally made in Python using a game engine called "Ursina", 
which literally means "little female bear". Ursina is built off of a different game 
engine called "Panda3D" which is largely made using the C programming language, 
Developed by Disney. Since my new engine was made using Ursina, I figured I'd continue 
the trend of bear named game engines and call it "Kodiak". This version was scrapped 
and never released, to be re-created using Javascript and Three.js. Though it's not 
at all related to Ursina or Panda3D anymore, I decided to keep the name because I 
think it sounds neat.
